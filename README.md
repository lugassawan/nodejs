- starting project by type 'node namefile.js'
- "require()" used to call module/file in another file
- 3rd party module can call like module from nodejs.org/api
- first put module in variabel, then call that variabel with the function "VarName.FunctionName()"
- module 'lodash' can be used for filter, validate an data/array/
- nodemon for serving the app and watching the change of files
- process.argv for get input user
